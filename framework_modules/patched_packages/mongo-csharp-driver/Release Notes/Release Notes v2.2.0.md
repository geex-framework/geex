## New Features

Notable new features are listed below. For a full list, see the list of JIRA issues linked above.

### Sync API

The 2.0 and 2.1 versions of the .NET driver featured a new async-only API. Some users gave us feedback
that they wanted a choice whether to use a sync or an async API. Version 2.2 introduces sync versions
of every async method.

- Support for bypassing document validation for write operations on collections where document validation
has been enabled
- Support for write concern for FindAndModify methods
- Support for read concern
- Builder support for new aggregation stages and new accumulators in $group stage
- Support for version 3 text indexes

## Upgrading

There are no known backwards breaking changes in this release.
